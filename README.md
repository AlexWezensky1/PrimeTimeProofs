# PrimeTimeProofs
This is the repository for all queries I used on my channel PrimeTimeProofs: https://www.youtube.com/@PrimeTimeProofs  
Prime Time Proofs is a channel dedicated to verifying sports statistics from videos, tiktoks, twitter, and TV with the help of SQL. We've made our own database with (almost) every NFL stat in existence with the help of nflreadr and Pro Football Reference.
